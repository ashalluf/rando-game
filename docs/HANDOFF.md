# Handoff: Rando Game (written 2026-09-19, after build 51)

This is the narrative handoff for whoever picks the project up next, from any Claude Code account
or as a person. `CLAUDE.md` is the rulebook and `docs/GAME_PLAN.md` is the roadmap plus the
decisions log; both stay the source of truth. This file is the story: where things stand, how
the day-to-day work goes, what is fragile, what to do next. Read all three before touching code.

## 1. What this is, in one paragraph

A 3D open-world chaos sandbox in Godot 4.7.2 (GDScript, Forward+ on desktop, Compatibility on the
web). Overpowered player (super jumps, unlimited boost, no fall damage), unlimited guns, an endless
seeded city with a west-coast layout (ocean, beach, pier, hills with a big sign, downtown skyline,
campus, airport, port, a peninsula in a bay), drivable cars, flyable jets, pedestrians that
ragdoll, traffic, day/night, a real sky. Everything original: no real names, logos or maps.

## 2. The owner and how they work (this decides everything)

- Prompts from a phone, usually cannot open the Godot editor. Everything must be doable by editing
  text files. Never leave a step that needs a click in the editor.
- Plays two ways: the macOS app from GitHub Releases (https://github.com/ashalluf/rando-game/releases/latest,
  first launch needs "Open Anyway" in Privacy & Security) and the browser build at
  https://ashalluf.github.io/rando-game/ (GitHub Pages, deployed by the same workflow).
- **Push straight to `main`. No branches, no pull requests.** Their explicit decision. Small pushes
  with "How to test" in the commit body and in the chat reply, plus the tunable values most likely
  to need changing. End every push report with the build number (`build-N`, the release tag).
- Standing rules they gave: **high-poly and realistic, never a low-poly look** (2026-09-19, they
  are aiming at consoles); **no more Meshy, Poly Haven only** (2026-09-19: "your Meshy assets
  suck, you can't color them properly"); the rifle is an AK-47; boost replaced sprint; **every Meshy prompt
  asks for the most ultra-realistic result possible**; they want more NPCs, a GTA-5-like skyline,
  a gorgeous sky, hills with roads and estates, a campus, a peninsula in the ocean, a bigger
  airport with flyable jets (all delivered in builds 46 to 51, see section 6).
- They report feel problems in plain words ("jump feels floaty", "can't turn"). Fix by tuning the
  `@export` values at the top of the relevant script and say exactly what changed.
- Tone of replies they like: short, direct, no fluff, tell them what to try. **Always attach
  screenshots in the chat** (owner, 2026-09-19: "so I don't need to do a git fetch every time").

```

## 4. The loop for every change

1. Edit text files. Keep feel numbers as `@export` with a `##` comment.
2. Run the headless check (about 4 minutes):
   ```
   GODOT=/path/to/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_linux.x86_64 tests/headless_check.sh
   ```
   It imports the project and runs `tests/smoke_test.tscn`. It fails on any script error, parse
   error or NaN. Never push red.
3. Optional but recommended for visual work: export the web build and screenshot it (section 5).
4. Update `docs/GAME_PLAN.md` (decisions log entry, newest on top) and `CLAUDE.md` if a convention
   changed. Update `docs/ASSETS.md` for any asset.
5. Commit with a short imperative subject and a body that says why and how to test. Push to
   `main`. The remote also has a mirror branch `claude/new-session-gm161g` that earlier sessions
   force-pushed to keep in sync; it is not needed and can be ignored or deleted.
6. Wait for the workflow (about 2 to 4 minutes). It publishes `build-N`. Tell the owner the number.
   Check it really passed; CI run 46 failed once on a physics-flaky check, fixed in build 50.

## 5. Setting up a fresh session (nothing is preinstalled anywhere)

```

```

Screenshot harness facts that cost hours to learn: the web build runs at about 1 FPS under
SwiftShader and Godot clamps frame time, so a 1 ms key tap in Playwright walks the player meters
and a 25 s in-game timer takes minutes of wall time. The harness presses no keys. Place the
camera with `?spawn=x,z,yaw,pitch[,y]` (desktop: `-- --spawn=...`), jump the clock with
`?hour=17.5`, and use `?showroom` to line up every car, pedestrian and jet at the spawn. Web
lighting is flat: judge geometry, materials and layout, not light. Forward+ effects (SDFGI, SSR,
volumetric fog, glow) have never been seen by any Claude session; only the owner's Mac shows them.

**Native renders without a browser (added build 64, `-- --nohud` hides the overlay):** the container has Xvfb and Mesa llvmpipe, so
Godot's real Compatibility renderer runs headless-ish and screenshots in ~20 s instead of the
web harness' minutes. `tools/glshot/building_shot.gd` renders one generated `Building` (env
`OUT`, `BSEED`, `FINISH`, `LOT`, `HMIN`, `HMAX`), `tools/glshot/city_shot.gd` renders the city
scene at a `--spawn` (env `OUT`, `FRAMES`). Both start with
`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1280x720x24" godot --rendering-driver opengl3
--display-driver x11 --audio-driver Dummy --path . --script tools/glshot/<file> --resolution 960x540`
(the usage line in each file has the full command). Use the building one to check any facade or
rooftop change before exporting: the build-64 "cage towers" (window frames at twice the wall
height, because a face center that already held the part's Y got the absolute row height added
again) took a whole session of web screenshots to diagnose and one native render to see.

## 6. Where the game stands (build 74)

Everything in the roadmap is done (milestones 1 to 8) plus the LA-style map, the realism passes,
the "map character" batch and the 2026-09-20 owner batch. Recent builds, newest first:

- 74: interior mapping on every window: real rooms with blinds behind the glass.
- 73: character pass: per-person clothing colour, height and gait, proper skin and cloth
  shading. Further realism is blocked on a Sketchfab API token (see the decisions log).
- 72: real generated palm trees and palm-lined streets across the city.
- 71: cars fly (stabilised air control, boost thrusts along the camera), rebuilt explosions
  (light flash, fireball, smoke, sparks, shockwave, scorch, camera shake), `tools/glshot/fx_shot.gd`.
- 70: cinematic realism pass: AgX tonemapping, sky-coloured ambient, SSIL, aerial-perspective
  and height fog, TAA + FSR 2.2, auto exposure, clearcoat car paint with a realistic palette,
  real grass blades.
- 69: quality levels scale crowds and traffic too; frame-time breakdown on the HUD.
- 68: starts fullscreen (F11 toggles), Meshy textures VRAM-compressed.
- 67: spawn lifted onto the rolling ground, under-ground recovery in city zones, 60 FPS cap.
- 66: populated city: people and parked cars per district (downtown core 2x), traffic density by
  distance from downtown, airport drop-off loop road with 90 crawling cars and a curb crowd.
- 65: animated main character (`Avatar`), ragdolls keep the real model, first lag pass
  (`Quality` node, flat window frames with a draw distance, pedestrian update throttle).
- 64: facade geometry (frames, cornices, awnings), Poly Haven rooftop AC units, `tools/glshot`.
- 63: weather (overcast / rain / storm, lightning, wet streets) and tsunami-size waves.
- 62: shopping plazas, big-box stores, fast-food and gas-station pads, lawns, pocket gardens.
- 61: street detail (stop lines, arrows, street-name signs, poles and cables, bus shelters).
- 60: cars drive forwards, two-tone paint shader, far-box windows, new minimap, unlimited jumps.
- 59: city relief (rolling ground under the blocks), seeded surface variation per district.
- 52 to 58: Poly Haven props, trees, rocks, PBR wall textures, sky haze fix, screenshot rule.
- 51: bigger airport (3 runways, hangars, jet bridges), flyable jets (`Aircraft`), AK-47 bullets
  now hit pedestrians (they were on the wrong physics layer for months of session time).
- 49: campus district and the campus hall landmark ("RANDO U").
- 48: hill road network with carved terrain, estates (villa, pool, palms), peninsula in a bay,
  ocean visible again (it had been rendering as grass under the ground follower plane).
- 47: skyline: taller downtown core, setback and crown towers, spires, the needle, twin towers.
- 46: custom sky shader: sun disc, clouds, golden hour, stars.
- 45: all seven Meshy models regenerated realistically; crowds doubled (160 people, 24 traffic
  cars on desktop; 80 / 14 on the web).
- 44: cars and pedestrians use Meshy models; `?showroom`.
- 43: the "stuck under the world" bugs (three real causes, see the decisions log).
- 42: fall-through recovery, Space jumps the car, round rotating minimap.

Meshy credits: 1,680 at the start, 1,221 after the owner topped up; each car 30, each rigged
pedestrian 44, each jet 30. `docs/ASSETS.md` has the table.

## 7. Architecture in ten bullets

- `CityStreamer` is the scene root: streams `CityChunk`s around the player (FULL near, LOD far),
  keeps a 4000 m ground follower under the player (40 m thick), re-centers the origin when far
  from 0 (`WorldState.world_offset`; everything that must survive that is a 3D child of the root),
  handles `?spawn`, `?showroom`, `surface_height_at()` and `ensure_loaded_at()`.
- `CityPlan` is lazy endless data keyed by block index; `MacroMap` decides zone, district and
  height for any world XZ; `HillRoads` carves roads and mansion pads into the terrain height.
- `CityChunk` builds one block: roads, sidewalks, lots of `Building`s (shader-driven boxes), props
  via `MultiMeshBatch` with breakables on the chunk's `StreetProps` body, parked cars and jets
  spawned under the city root and freed with the chunk unless driven, terrain / water / sand /
  tarmac for other zones, hill roads and estates, landmarks in its rect.
- `Landmarks` is a static list with builders; far copies always exist, detailed ones per chunk.
- `Vehicle` is a VehicleBody3D built in code (box collision, Meshy body model tinted by paint);
  `Aircraft` extends it with an arcade flight model; `TrafficManager` drives kinematic ones.
- `Pedestrian` is a CharacterBody3D wandering a sidewalk ring with a rigged Meshy model
  (`custom_aabb` needed, faces +Z, material sanitized), becomes a box `Ragdoll` when knocked.
- `Player` handles movement, boost, jumps, weapons, riding, exit-spot search, and recovery from
  falling through the world or ending up under hill terrain (terrain has its own physics layer).
- `DayNight` drives the sun, the sky shader's colors and `night_factor`.
- Physics layers: 1 world, 2 player, 4 props, 8 npc, 16 terrain. `Player.AIM_MASK` = 1|4|8.
- `PhysicsBudget` caps live rigid bodies and never freezes vehicles (frozen wheels give NaN).

## 8. Hard-won gotchas (the full list is the decisions log)

- The city ground is not flat: `MacroMap.relief_at()` rolls up to 16 m. Chunk code samples it
  through `_gy()`; the multimesh batch and `_add_slab()` / `_add_prop()` add it for you, nodes
  you position yourself need it added once. Buildings carry a concrete plinth for the slope.
- Never `reparent()` a VehicleBody3D; never freeze one; never give a kinematic one wheels.
- Godot's `engine_force` pushes toward local +Z; the car negates it.
- Physics queries are stale for a frame after an origin shift (`_query_hold`).
- Bodies spawned overlapping a static shape get shot through thin floors; far chunks now carry
  collision for buildings and terrain so nothing sits inside a footprint when detail arrives.
- Every Meshy car model has its nose along +X: `Vehicle.MODEL_YAW` -PI/2 puts it at -Z, the
  physics forward. Car paint is `shaders/car_paint.gdshader` (luminance split), not a tint.
- Meshy: rigs have a cm skeleton under a 0.01 armature; animated exports drop PBR maps and set
  metallic 1 + emissive; models come out along +X or -X (`MODEL_YAW` tables); car paint needs the
  base color greyscaled (`shrink_glb.py --desaturate`) so the tint works.
- The smoke test is physics-driven and can flake; the driving checks now start on a cleared
  road with traffic and crowds removed, and the jet taxi lane must stay clear of landmark parts.
- The `.import` files and extracted `_N.jpg` textures next to `.glb` files are import output and
  are committed; stale `*_texture_0.png` files from older imports get deleted before committing.
- `project.godot` must stay in Godot's own section order or the editor rewrites it.
- `import_etc2_astc=true` must stay on or the universal macOS export fails.

## 9. Known gaps and things nobody has verified

- Nobody has seen the Forward+ (Mac) rendering of the sky, skyline haze, hills or estates. The
  owner's feedback decides the tuning. Expect requests about brightness, cloud amount, sunset
  length and night darkness (`DayNight` exports).
- Ragdolls are still six boxes, not the character mesh.
- Traffic drives only the city grid; hill roads and the airport have no traffic. Parked cars do
  not spawn on hill roads. Pedestrians do not walk the campus quad paths or the hills.
- Jet landing has not been exercised beyond the smoke test's takeoff. Gear is tiny and hidden
  under the model; the flight model is arcade and may need tuning (`aircraft.gd` exports).
- The moon is the sun light re-aimed at night; the sky draws its disc where LIGHT0 points.
- LOD terrain (6 subdivisions) vs FULL (14 or 28) can pop at the swap; hill road cut walls are
  steep where the road profile drops well below the raw terrain.
- The web build carries all the models and runs slowly on weak machines; caps are lower there.
- The Meshy API key the owner pasted in chat during this project should be rotated; the new one
  goes in the Claude Code environment as `MESHY_API_KEY`.

## 10. Suggested next steps, in order of impact

1. Ask the owner what they saw on the Mac for builds 46 to 51 and tune before adding more.
2. Building facades: Meshy-generated facade modules (storefront, mid floors, roof) that the city
   generator stacks, with real brick / glass / concrete PBR. Biggest remaining visual jump.
3. Real ragdolls from the character mesh (PhysicalBoneSimulator3D on the Meshy skeleton).
4. Animation blending for pedestrians (idle / walk / run, turning), reactions to cars and gunfire.
5. Traffic and parked cars on hill roads; pedestrians on the campus and the pier.
6. Post-processing: motion blur, bloom on lights, film grain, color grading.
7. Weather (rain with wet-road reflections), streetlights and shop signs at night, headlights.
8. Meshy-generated trees, benches, hydrants, lamps; more pedestrian variety and clothing.

## 11. Quick test script to give the owner after any push

"Grab build-N from the Releases page (or the browser build with ?showroom). Walk, shoot a
pedestrian, take a car across town and into the hills, get out on a slope, fly a jet from the
airport, watch a sunset (Esc shows the clock). Tell me what looks or feels wrong."
